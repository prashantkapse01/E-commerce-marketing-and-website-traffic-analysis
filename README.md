# E-commerce-marketing-and-website-traffic-analysis

This project focused on analysing e-commerce website data and marketing campaigns, optimizing traffic sources, and improving conversion rates. The goal was to derive strategic insights to enhance marketing efficiency and drive business growth.

I spearheaded an e-commerce marketing and website traffic analysis project utilizing MySQL, Power BI. The primary focus was to understand traffic sources, optimize paid marketing campaigns, and analyse website content to enhance user experience and conversion rates. Key activities included analysing search data to optimize budget allocation, leveraging UTM parameters for detailed campaign performance tracking, and conducting bid optimization to maximize marketing ROI. 

Additionally, I performed in-depth analysis on top website content and user conversion funnels, identifying critical areas for improvement. Seasonal and product sales trends were monitored to anticipate future demand and inform product strategy. By providing comprehensive insights into traffic sources, user behaviour, and marketing effectiveness, the project aimed to enhance strategic decision-making and drive business growth. The results demonstrated significant improvements in session-to-order conversion rates and overall marketing efficiency, positioning Volltreffer Sports for continued success in the competitive e-commerce landscape.
